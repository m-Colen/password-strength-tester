# Password Strength Tester 

For this build I created a tool that allows users to check their password strenght level by entering in a potential password. 

The main focus of this project was to use RegEx to help determine the level of password strength.  

The indicators of password strength for this project include:
* The number of lowercase characters.  
* The number of uppercase characters.  
* The length of the password.  
* The number of digits.  
* The number of special characters.  
* The number of repeating characters.  

Overall, this was a fun build that taught me a lot about using RegEx for a practical purpose.
